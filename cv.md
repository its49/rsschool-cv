### About
&nbsp;Doing everything i can to fight my EX-rank procrastination and get control over my fate.\
&nbsp;I always loved IT and the fact how it affects our world, the future is obviously on its shoulders. Especially, the coding part and\
&nbsp;very essence of it, how it feels to code and bring astonishing projects to live. I ​want to partake, create/help with something\
​&nbsp;special. I'll skip the speeches 'bout big ambitions and bright future, by now let's see if i can reach frontend and catch up\
&nbsp;with amazing devs out there.
Btw it is ironic i've got best possible contact links, but no one's gonna contact me anyway,\
&nbsp;at least now.
